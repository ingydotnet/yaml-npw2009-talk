            Schema - The Meaning of YAML - The Grey Zone
     
     Q: How do you know what a random YAML document means?
     A: You don't!
     
     * YAML meaning is context sensitive
     * It is a contract between a Loader and a Dumper
     * It is a contract between two developers
     * It is validated by a test system
     * The contract does not (yet) have a formal standard
     * YAML will someday have a formal schema language
       * Y-OK and Rx are attempts
     * For now it is a programmer understanding
     * Backed by good tests, when needed
